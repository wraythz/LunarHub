This is just some batch file that I decided to make in school, then just decided to work on it more

# How to Use:
Run the .exe lmao

# Where's the source code?
In the discord (Not released yet, not my fault if you think this is a RAT lmao)

# Why does VirusTotal mark this as Trojan?
To be completely honest, I am unsure. If you would like, view the Source Code in the Discord. If you really want to go deep into it, uncompile it. It's only a batch file, so it shouldn't be difficult. It may be because of the Compiler, etc. If you find any potential reason as to why, please make a ticket in the Discord.
